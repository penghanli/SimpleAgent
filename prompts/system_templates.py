                       [<Thinking>] Making yogurt at home is a straightforward process. Here’s a simple method you can follow:

1. **Ingredients Needed:**
   - Milk (whole or 2%)
   - Yogurt starter (store-bought plain yogurt with active cultures)

2. **Equipment Needed:**
   - Saucepan
   - Thermometer
   - Whisk
   - Jar or container with a lid
   - Warm towel or heating pad

3. **Steps:**
   1. **Heat the Milk:** Pour the milk into a saucepan and heat it gently over medium heat until it reaches about 180°F (82°C). This step helps to change the protein structure in the milk so it sets as a solid rather than separating.
   
   2. **Cool the Milk:** Remove the milk from the heat and let it cool to about 110°F (43°C). You can accelerate the cooling process by placing the saucepan in an ice bath.

   3. **Inoculate the Milk with Yogurt Starter:** Take a small amount of the cooled milk and mix it with the yogurt starter. Whisk it back into the rest of the milk in the saucepan.

   4. **Incubate the Yogurt:** Pour the milk into a clean jar or container. Cover it with a lid and wrap it with a warm towel or place it on a heating pad. Maintain a temperature of about 110°F (43°C). Let it sit for 5-10 hours, depending on the desired thickness and tanginess.

   5. **Refrigerate the Yogurt:** Once the yogurt has set to your liking, refrigerate it for at least 2 hours before consuming. This stops the fermentation process.

Note: Make sure your utensils are clean to prevent contamination, and store the yogurt in a fridge.

[<Final>] Follow these steps to make yogurt at home using milk and a yogurt starter, with necessary equipment such as a saucepan and thermometer. Enjoy your homemade yogurt!
